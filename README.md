# A list of resources for students, collaborators (and myself)

A list of useful resources for a modern, transparent and reproducible scientific workflow. These resources cover many stages of the scientific process from designing an experimental procedure to writing a report and collaborating with others. This list will be continuously updated. However, this list is not intended to be exhaustive. Instead, it aims to provide only a minimal set of essential resources to get acquainted with the topic (at most five resources per section).

## Open science, a transparent and reproducible workflow

The way we do research in Psychology quickly evolved during the last decade. To tackle issues related to the [researcher degrees of freedom](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956797611417632) (amongst other things), novel practises emerged. For instance, it is now common practise to register in advance (i.e., before data collection) the hypotheses to be examined, the way data will be collected and analysed, etc. The following resources will guide you through these new practises and their practical implementation.

### Preregistration and (replication) registered reports

* The preregistration revolution [Nosek et al., 2018](https://www.pnas.org/content/115/11/2600)).

* What are [registered reports](https://cos.io/rr/) ? 

### Version control and automation, a reproducible workflow

Using Git and Github, eventually from RStudio.

* Curating Research Assets: A Tutorial on the Git Version Control System (Vuorre & Curley, [2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245918754826))

* RStudio, Git and Github (Wickham, [2015](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/git.html))

### Data collection

...

* A fully automatised, transparent, reproducible and blind protocol for sequential analyses (Beffara, Bret, & Nalborczyk, [2019](https://osf.io/mwtvk/)).

### Analysing data

...

* MOOC - Improving your statistical inferences (Lakens, [2017](https://www.coursera.org/learn/statistical-inferences))
* Course - Statistical Rethinking: A Bayesian Course Using R and Stan (McElreath, [2019](https://github.com/rmcelreath/statrethinking_winter2019)).

## Writing empirical papers

### Writing style

* Writing and Revising, writing guide (Simmons, [2019](http://www.dansimons.com/resources/Simons_on_writing_1.5.pdf))

* Writing Empirical Articles: Transparency, Reproducibility, Clarity, and Memorability (Gernsbacher, [2018](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/2515245918754485))

*  Improving Scholarly Communication: An Online Course (Gernsbacher, [2013](https://osf.io/c4xyq/))

* Teaching Graduate Students How to Write Clearly (Wagenmakers, [2009](http://www.ejwagenmakers.com/2009/TeachingTipsWriting.pdf))

* Writing the Empirical Journal Article (Bem, [2002](https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/0403/b24ae2c7dbe81c05529436167646f1b21c08.pdf))

### Writing transparent and reproducible empirical papers

* LaTex + Overleaf v2 permits to collaborate online on LaTex documents: https://www.overleaf.com/
* Writing paper from RStudio in RMarkdown with the [papaja package](https://github.com/crsh/papaja) (APA6-formatted manuscripts)
